RULES:
- Everything must fit one A4 page when pasted into Word (12pt, standard margins)
- No full sentences — fragments, abbreviations, and shorthand are fine
- Every item must come from the Stage 2 analysis — do not add new content
- If there isn't enough content for a cell, leave it as "—" rather than inventing
