SINGLE SPEAKER MODE: Lecture recording, one primary speaker.
Default to [Lecturer] unless clearly a student question.

AUDIO CONTEXT: High student participation - multiple student voices throughout.

SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY:
- [Lecturer]: Extended exposition, references to readings/assessment, pedagogical framing
- [Student 1], [Student 2], etc.: Only distinguish between students if voices are clearly different AND the distinction matters for understanding
- [Student]: Use generic [Student] for most student contributions - don't waste effort distinguishing unless content requires it
- [Class discussion]: Use for rapid back-and-forth or overlapping voices where individual attribution adds no value
- [Inaudible student comment]: Use when you hear a student speak but can't make out words

PRIORITIZATION:
Focus cleaning effort on the lecturer's content. Student contributions:
- Clean if substantive (good question, extended point, case example)
- Minimal cleaning if brief (simple "yes", agreement, clarification request)
- [Multiple students responding] if it's just general class noise/agreement

The goal is a usable study guide, not a court transcript. If 5 students say similar things, capture the point once rather than attributing each voice.

Clean this filtered transcript. Work ONLY with what is in the transcript – do not add, infer, or invent content.

CLEANING RULES:

1. FILLER REMOVAL (selective, not blanket)
   Remove: um, uh, ah, er, "you know" (as filler), "sort of" / "kind of" (as hedging), "basically", "literally" (as emphasis), false starts and repeated phrases.
   KEEP: "okay" or "right" when used as a topic transition marker (e.g., "Right, so the next point is..."). Remove when used as verbal tics or tag questions ("...right?" at end of sentence seeking agreement).

2. TRANSCRIPTION ERROR CORRECTION
   Fix obvious Whisper errors using surrounding context: homophones (e.g., "their/there"), garbled technical terms, statute names, author names. If unsure, keep the original and flag as [transcription uncertain: "original text"].

3. PARAGRAPHING
   Create new paragraphs at topic shifts, not at pauses. Use ## headers ONLY for major section changes (new topic, new activity, return from break). Do not over-section – a 50-minute lecture should have roughly 4-8 headers, not 20.

4. SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION
   Apply these heuristics (no diarisation available):
   - [Lecturer]: Extended exposition, references to "your reading," "the exam," "when I worked at," "importantly," pedagogical framing
   - [Student]: Shorter utterances, questions ("Sorry, can I ask...," "Does that mean...," "I'm confused about..."), interruptions
   - [Group discussion]: Multiple overlapping voices, workshop/seminar segments
   - [Speaker?]: Use when genuinely uncertain – do not guess
   - [Multiple voices]: Use for chaotic segments where individual attribution is impossible

5. UNCLEAR AUDIO
   - Brief gaps: [inaudible: ~2 words] or [inaudible: sounds like "mandatory reporting"]
   - Extended gaps (>15 seconds): [inaudible segment: approximately X seconds, topic context: Y]
   - Poor quality sections: [poor audio quality: partial capture] followed by best-effort text in italics

6. PRESERVE EXACTLY AS STATED
   All citations, case names (e.g., Re B [2000]), statute references (e.g., Care Act 2014, s.42), dates, statistics, percentages, and proper nouns. Do not "correct" these even if they sound wrong – flag with [sic?] if clearly erroneous.

7. SPELLING & CONVENTIONS
   UK spelling throughout: behaviour, organisation, centre, defence, programme, practise (verb), practice (noun).

8. TIMESTAMPS
   Remove all timestamp clutter. Only retain a timestamp if it marks a structurally important moment (e.g., start of a new activity, return from break): [00:32:15 – Group activity begins].

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Markdown with ## headers for major sections only
- Paragraphs for exposition, bullet points only for actual lists spoken as lists
- Chronological order maintained
- No summary, no analysis, no commentary – clean transcript only
