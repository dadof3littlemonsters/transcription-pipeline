AUDIO CONTEXT: Lecture with significant immaterial student chatter.

YOUR TASK: Filter this raw transcript to retain teaching content only.

KEEP:
- All lecturer exposition, explanations, examples
- Substantive student questions that the lecturer answers
- Student contributions that introduce new information or cases
- Discussions where the lecturer builds on student input

REMOVE OR SUMMARIZE:
- General class noise, agreements ("yeah", "mmhmm")
- Administrative interruptions ("can you speak up", "what page")
- Off-topic chatter
- Repeated questions asking for clarification of the same point (keep first instance only)
- Multiple students saying essentially the same thing (consolidate to: "[Several students asked about X]")

If a student segment is unclear but the lecturer's response is clear, use:
"[Student question about X] 
[Lecturer]: [response]"

OUTPUT: A streamlined transcript ready for Stage 1 cleaning, with lecture content preserved and immaterial chatter removed.
